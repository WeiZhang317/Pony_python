# Tesnsorflew Practice

## Tesnsorflew
File tensor_cor.py implements
[Variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance)
[Covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance)
and [Correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence)
with tensorflew.
It's good practice for those who trying to understand tensorflew's methodology.
Also a good start for implementing a [Distributed Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) version Correlation.

File data-flow-graph.pdf is a good article for understanding Data Flow Graphs.
Found it at [Data Flow Graphs Intro](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mperkows/temp/JULY/data-flow-graph.pdf).

## Machine Learning

File tensor_lm.py demonstrates how to train(or fit) [linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_model),
codes are extract from tensorflow's tutorial.
