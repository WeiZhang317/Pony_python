# Tensorflow Practice

## Tensorflow
File tensor_cor.py implements
[variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance),
[covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance),
and [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence)
with tensorflow.
It's a good practice for those who try to understand tensorflow's methodology.
Also, it is a good start for implementing a [distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) version Correlation.

File data-flow-graph.pdf is a good article for understanding Data Flow Graphs.
Found it at [Data Flow Graphs Intro](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mperkows/temp/JULY/data-flow-graph.pdf).

## Machine Learning

File tensor_lm.py demonstrates how to train (or fit) [linear model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_model).
Codes are extracted from tensorflow's tutorial.
